# Difficulties Faced During the Project

During this Metasploit Level 01 project, I faced several difficulties.

---

## 1️⃣ VM Not Booting
At first, Metasploitable 2 was not booting properly.
Solution:
Disabled UEFI Boot and attached Linux ISO temporarily.

---

## 2️⃣ Network Issues
Kali could not ping Metasploitable initially.
Solution:
Checked both machines were using same network mode (Shared Network).

---

## 3️⃣ IP Address Confusion
Had difficulty finding correct target IP.
Used:
ifconfig

to identify the correct IP address.

---

## 4️⃣ Understanding Nmap Results
Initially, it was difficult to understand service versions and port numbers.
After researching, I understood how open ports relate to vulnerabilities.

---

## Learning Outcome
Through this project I learned:
- How to set up virtual labs
- How to scan networks using Nmap
- Basic understanding of penetration testing workflow
